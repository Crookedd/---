              <p>As one of the alpine countries, landlocked Switzerland with her mountains has to compete not only with her neighbours but with other destinations. There are, e.g., no coastal resorts. </p>
              <p>The advantage is that tourism in Switzerland benefits of a large diversity of beautiful landscapes in a relatively small space.</p>

        <p>The advantage is that tourism in Switzerland benefits of a large diversity of beautiful landscapes in a relatively small space, offering many possibilities for various activities all the year round, in all seasons, although primarily in summer and winter. The offers of nature as well as culture are manifold, but unfortunately price levels throughout the country are high, and this can discourage many people from visiting. Despite this major drawback, millions of visitors from all over the world arrive(d) every year.</p>
